Easily use shortcodes in your pages, posts and widgets.

== Description ==
Copy-Paste and edit php and other codes in CodeMirror, preview the result within popup and simply add it to posts, pages, and widgets using shortcodes.

= What are shortcodes? =
Shortcodes are an elegant manner to include piece of code in your wordpress content. For example you can use it to manage form codes from Mailchimp, poMMo, SG-Autorepondeur or other autoresponders, using php code to collect date or geolocalize your visitors, etc. WordPress will then automatically replace shortcode like [sce name="myshortcode"] with the content of your choosing AND will be able to execute code within it.

= Why use Shortcode Express? =
Derived from the excellent Shortcode Manager WP plugin (many thanks to Matt Gibbs), Shortcode Express make the shortcode management more intuitive and easier for integrating with posts, pages and widgets. 

= Usage =
* Add shortcodes within Tools -> Shortcode Express.
* Use [sce name="myshortcode"] within your posts, pages or widgets.
